x = "joini"

print(x)

y = 5 

print(y)


#x and y are variable 

#we gave x the value of joini, and we print the Vairable in the concale

#thus we get joini as output

#the same thang applies to y but it prints 5 insted of joini

#and we can chage the variables name,

#we mostly name Variables to what they do 

#variables  ontainers that hold values. They can be used to store anything 

#like data types like integers and strings
